## Arina: The App

#### Premise

The evolution of social platforms has led us to a world where everything on the internet has to be picture-perfect. This sets a bad example for many impressionable children and takes away from what social media was meant for. Arina was designed to build in as many features as it could to encourage users to be not only be comfortable posting informally, but nurture relations between users and focus on the world around them.

#### App Design

Arina will allow a user to post images and messages on three seperate visibility levels: public, group and individual level.

#### Design Flow

#### Design Choices

The app is built in the Swift Programming Language. User information is stored in a MySQL database while posts, conversations and other dynamic information is stored in a MongoDB database.
